1. Scope and Purpose 
This guide is a collaborative resource for professionals working with immersive audio technologies and implementations. Rather than presenting absolute rules, it offers frameworks for decision-making and highlights considerations that have proven valuable in professional practice. As our field rapidly evolves, we recognize that today's best practices may need to adapt to tomorrow's innovations. 
We approach these best practices with the understanding that immersive audio is a multifaceted field where diNerent contexts often require diNerent solutions. This guide distinguishes between established technical standards, common industry practices, and emerging approaches. When multiple valid approaches exist, we present the advantages and limitations of each, allowing practitioners to make informed decisions based on their specific requirements. 
The framework for this guide is as follows:
- Technical Foundations: Where possible, we ground recommendations in established acoustic principles, technical standards, and peer-reviewed research.
- Industry Practice: We document widely adopted workflows while acknowledging that alternative approaches may better serve specific situations.
- Emerging Technologies: We examine promising new techniques and technologies, clearly indicating their experimental nature and potential limitations. 
 
This guide does not claim to be exhaustive or definitive. We acknowledge that some areas of immersive audio practice are still evolving and diNerent industry segments may have conflicting requirements. Regional variations, economic constraints and practical limitations may influence implementation choices. 
Technical capabilities continue to advance rapidly and we encourage readers to consider these practices within their specific context. Sharing experiences and alternative approaches is important if we want to question assumptions and contribute with new perspectives. This guide represents our current understanding of best practices in immersive audio, based on both established principles and emerging professional experience. As technologies and techniques continue to develop, we expect these practices to evolve through collaborative discussion and practical implementation.
